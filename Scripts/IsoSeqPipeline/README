Details for running the isoseq pipeline

Run the following commands from the github repository main folder

## Iso-Seq pipeline

1. sbatch Scripts/JobSubmission/batchProcessIsoSeqData.sh
	searchs for all files with sufix .subreads.bam then executes the following scripts for each sample:
	
	* processIsoSeqSMRTcells.sh runs the isoseq3 pipeline including ccs, lima, refine, cluster and polish steps.
	* alignIsoSeqSMRTcells.sh aligns the processed data using minimap2
	* filterIsoSeqSMRTcells.sh performs filtering on the on the aligned transcripts using cupcake scripts
	* alignShortReadSMRTcells.sh aligns short read data to gff for use in sqanti qc
	* sqanti3SMRTcells.sh QCs SMRT-cell level transcriptomes prior to merging
	
2. smrt cell level qc summary
	qcSMRT.r
	
3. sbatch Scripts/IsoSeqPipeline/createMasterTranscriptomeFromSMRTcells.sh
	use talon to mark reads for internal priming and merge smrt cell transcriptomes into single master transcriptomes. Compare to GENCODE for annotation of known isoforms

4. Scripts/IsoSeqPipeline/compareMasterTranscriptomeExistingGTF.sh
	use gffcompare to compare master transcriptome with 

5. characterise transcriptome

## RNA-Seq data pipeline

1. sbatch --array=<number of jobs> Scripts/JobSubmission/runRNASeqAlignment.sh <folder with fastq files> <Project Name>
	* fastqc, trimGalore, align with STAR to GENCODE
	* quantify GENCODE transcripts with RSEM
	* RNASEQ-QC
	
2. sbatch --array=0-49%10 Scripts/JobSubmission/runAlignmentBrainTranscriptome.sh <folder with fastq files> <Project Name>
	* align with STAR to GENCODE
	* quantify Brain Transcritpome
	
3. feature counting
