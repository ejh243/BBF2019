Details for running the isoseq pipeline

Run the following commands from the github repository main folder

1. sbatch Scripts/IsoSeqPipeline/batchProcessIsoSeqData.sh
	searchs for all files with sufix .subreads.bam then executes the following scripts for each sample:
	
	* processIsoSeqSMRTcells.sh runs the isoseq3 pipeline including ccs, lima, refine, cluster and polish steps.
	* alignIsoSeqSMRTcells.sh aligns the processed data using minimap2
	* filterIsoSeqSMRTcells.sh performs filtering on the on the aligned transcripts using cupcake scripts
	* alignShortReadSMRTcells.sh aligns short read data to gff for use in sqanti qc
	* sqanti3QCIsoSeqSMRTcells QCs SMRT-cell level transcriptomes prior to merging
	
2. smrt cell level qc summary
